## Description of Project

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or ham. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide an efficient solution for filtering unwanted emails and reducing the clutter.

The project utilizes a dataset of labeled emails to train a machine learning model. Various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, feature engineering, and classification algorithms are employed to build an effective spam detection system.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [UCI Machine Learning Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). It consists of a collection of labeled emails classified as spam and ham. The dataset provides a diverse set of email samples for training and evaluation purposes.
The dataset contains a large number of emails, both spam and non-spam, with associated labels indicating their respective classes.
## Features

- Text-based features such as the presence of specific keywords,  the frequency of certain words, and the length of the email.
- Accurately classifies emails as spam or ham.
- Easy integration with existing email systems.
- Minimal false positives and false negatives


## Installation

To set up the email spam detection system, follow these steps:
 
 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/tabish78600/Email-spam1.git
  $ cd Email-spam1
```
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ build.sh
```
    
## Usage

1. Run the email spam detection system:

```bash
$ Streamlit run app.py
```
2. Provide the necessary input, such as the email content or metadata, as prompted by the system.

3. The system will output the classification result, indicating whether the email is spam or ham.
